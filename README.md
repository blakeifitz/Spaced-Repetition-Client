# Spaced Repetition

This app was created to demonstrate spaced repetition style learning. I chose French as an example.

The more often you get a word correct the less often the user will see it. The more often you get it incorrect the more you will see that word.

The the client app has a dashboard which displays the words, your guesses, and total correct. There is a learning page that will display the words and allow the user to guess.
